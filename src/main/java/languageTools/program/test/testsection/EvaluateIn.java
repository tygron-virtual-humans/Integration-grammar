/**
 * Evaluate-in statement. The evaluate-in statement evaluates a list of
 * {@link TestCondition}s while executing an action or module.
 *
 * The queries in the evaluate-in statement are evaluated by a
 * {@link TestConditionEvaluator}. Each {@link TestCondition} provides an
 * evaluator that can be used to evaluate that condition.
 *
 * When an test condition is evaluated, the corresponding evaluator is run as
 * debugger. The evaluators are {@link DebugObserver}s that listen to
 * {@link Channel#ACTION_EXECUTED_BUILTIN} and
 * {@link Channel#ACTION_EXECUTED_USERSPEC}.
 *
 * Evaluation of the test conditions happens in three phases.
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>Install evaluators.
 * <li>Trigger {@link TestConditionEvaluator#firstEvaluation()}.
 * <li>Execute the action associated with {@link EvaluateIn} using the installed
 * Evaluators. Whenever an action is executed the test condition is evaluated.
 * <li>Trigger {@link TestConditionEvaluator#lastEvaluation()}.
 * <li>Uninstall evaluators.
 * <ol>
