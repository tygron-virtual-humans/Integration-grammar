/**
 * Action that makes the agent focus on a module, using one of four methods;
 * <ol>
 * <li>When the action is executed, and the agent focuses on the module, the new
 * attention set will consist of one goal, which validates the entire context of
 * the {@link Module}.<br>
 * To use this method, focus on a Module with the {@link FocusMethod#SELECT}
 * focus method.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note that this method has better performance, as no new databases need to be
 * created due to the context. (there still might be some module-specific goals
 * to be created however)<br>
 * <br>
 * </li>
 * <li>When the action is executed, and the agent focuses on the module, the new
 * attention set will consist of one goal for each of the positive
 * {@link GoalLiteral} and {@link AGoalLiteral}s in the instantiated context.<br>
 * To use this method, focus on a Module with the {@link FocusMethod#FILTER}
 * focus method.<br>
 * <br>
 * Note that this method makes the agent forget any information on its goals on
 * a lower level than the information provided in the positive goal and a-goal
 * literals. Eg (in blocksworld): a context with only
 * <code>a-goal(tower[T])</code> will make the agent forget that its original
 * goal was a conjunction of <code>on(.,.)</code> predicates.</li>
 * <li>When the action is executed, and the agent focuses on the module, the new
 * attention set will be empty.<br>
 * To use this method, focus on a Module with the {@link FocusMethod#NEW} focus
 * method.</li>
 * <li>When the action is executed, and the agent focuses on the module, the new
 * attention set will be the same attention set as before (aside from any added
 * goals from the <code>goals { }</code> section). This means that any changes
 * in the attention set will be propagated back to the parent module when the
 * agent de-focuses.<br>
 * To use this method, focus on a Module with the {@link FocusMethod#NONE} focus
 * method.
 * </ol>
 * Note that regardless of the focus method, the new attention set will always
 * contain the goals defined in the Module's <code>goals { }</code> section.
